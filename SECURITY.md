## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly
Send an email to: **security@personalfinance.app**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information (optional)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 4. Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **High**: Significant security risk requiring prompt attention
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk with available workarounds
- **Low**: Minor security issue with minimal impact

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- API keys and tokens are securely stored
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with secure cookies
- Multi-factor authentication support (planned)

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- XSS protection with proper output encoding
- CSRF protection with token validation

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Secure configuration management

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security code reviews

### Development Environment
- Use secure development practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use secure coding practices
- Test security features thoroughly

## Security Features

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities reported privately
2. **Assessment Period**: Time to assess and fix the issue
3. **Coordinated Release**: Coordinated release of fixes
4. **Public Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fixes are available

### Credit Policy
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in our security advisories
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Eligible for our bug bounty program (coming soon)

## Security Updates

### Regular Updates
