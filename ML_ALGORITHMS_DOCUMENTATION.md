This document provides comprehensive information about all machine learning algorithms used in the Personal Finance application, their theoretical foundations, and real-world applications.

## üß† Algorithms Used in This Application

### 1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**

#### **Theory:**
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents. It increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.

**Formula:**
```
TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) √ó IDF(t)
TF(t,d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)
IDF(t) = log(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)
```

#### **Implementation in Our App:**

### 2. **Linear Regression**

#### **Theory:**
Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

**Formula:**
```
y = mx + b
where:

- m = slope (coefficient)
- b = y-intercept
```

**Mathematical Foundation:**

### 5. **Moving Average**

#### **Theory:**
Moving average is a statistical technique that smooths out short-term fluctuations to reveal long-term trends.

**Formula:**
```
MA(n) = (X‚ÇÅ + X‚ÇÇ + ... + X‚Çô) / n
where:
- MA(n) = n-period moving average
- X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô = data points
- n = number of periods
```
